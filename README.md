This project is made to learn how React dynamically works with server and database, by using node/express.js and postgresql via knex package in our server.

There is still many things i'll try to improve my APP in the mean time:
* Inputs validation
* Error msg during signing/registration or even add a toast :D
* Add FORM component (to handle Signin/Registration in one component)
* Router improvement (maybe)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

We need backend yet:
### Backend link...
You need to clone Back-End repository and also run a server on port that you will type at the bottom of `server.js` in listen(...). Once you've done that, just start the server:
### `npm start`
Now it should work with your backend, also it's really important to keep proper ports with endpoints of our server
